# pokemon-practice-problem

    You are given 2 lists:
    - pokemon_names: a list off all the known pokemon names (will refer as generic name)
    - card_names: a list of all the pokemon card names

    You recently found out that a pokemon card can have multiple pokemon in it.  
    You would like to be able to show what pokemon_names (generic pokemon) are in each pokemon card. 
    Pokemon cards can include anywhere from 0, 3 generic pokemon within it. 
    Pokemon cards can also have false names inside () indicating promotion cards, etc.

    Your goal is for every pokemon card map all the generic pokemon within it
